# <Workday Planner>

## Description

I started this project to further my proficiency with 3rd party web API's, such as JQuery and Day.JS. With the help of some starter code, 
I created a workday planner. This application allows users to schedule their day by the hour. After completing this project, I feel much more 
confident working with web API's and with JavaScript in general.

## Installation

To install and run this application, just pull the code from the repository, open the code in an IDE, and run it in your browser of choice.

## Usage

In order to use this application, all you have to do is type what you have planned for the day in each time block. From there,
click the save button to save what you typed. Each time block will change color depending on if it is in the past, present, or future. 
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

## Credits

I would like to say thank you to my tutor Andres Long. He helped me with pulling the data that gets saved to local storage back to the planner page.
Also shoutout to AskBCS. It is a very helpful resource for when I get stuck. Good people over there.
